First I loaded the blinkpoll code onto the board to make sure all my software was running correctly. 
I then attached the coin selector to the board such that the ground and power were directly on the board, and the coin detector was attached to D0 a 10k resistor and VDD. 
I then started writing the code based on the blink poll code.
I kept the front matter and the peice of code that made switches 1 and 2 control LED 1 and 3, except I switched LED 1 rom being controled by switch 2 to being controled by d0.
Now wehen a coin is put in the slot LED 1 blinks.
